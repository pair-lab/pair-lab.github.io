title: 'Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning'

summary: official implementation of Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) algorithms
abstract: 'This repository contains the official implementation of Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) algorithms, including HAPPO, HATRPO, HAA2C, HADDPG, HATD3, HAD3QN, and HASAC, based on PyTorch. HARL algorithms are markedly different from MAPPO in that they are generally applicable to heterogeneous agents and are supported by rigorous theories, often achieving superior performance. This repository allows researchers and practitioners to easily reproduce our results on seven challenging benchmarks or apply HARL algorithms to their intended applications.'
