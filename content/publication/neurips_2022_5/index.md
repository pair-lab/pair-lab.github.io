abstract: 'Promoting behavioural diversity is of critical importance in multi-agent reinforcement learning, since it helps the agent population maintain robust performance when encountering unfamiliar opponents at test time, or,  when the game is highly non-transitive in the strategy space (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissor). While a myriad of diversity metrics have been proposed, there are no widely accepted or unified  definitions in the literature, making the consequent diversity-aware learning algorithms difficult to evaluate and the insights elusive. In this work, we propose a novel  metric called the Unified Diversity Measure (UDM) that offers a unified view for existing diversity metrics. Based on UDM, we design the UDM-Fictitious Play (UDM-FP) and UDM-Policy Space Response Oracle (UDM-PSRO) algorithms as efficient solvers for  normal-form games and open-ended games. In theory, we prove that UDM-based methods can enlarge the gamescape by increasing the response capacity of the strategy pool, and have convergence guarantee to two-player Nash equilibrium. We validate our  algorithms on games that show strong non-transitivity, and empirical results show that our algorithms achieve better performances than strong PSRO baselines in terms of the exploitability and population effectivity. '

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: In this study, we further examine the theoretical convergence rate and sample complexity of such regret minimization-based double oracle methods, utilizing a unified framework called RegretMinimizing Double Oracle.
