ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we quantify the non-transitivity in chess using human game data. Specifically, we perform non-transitivity quantification in two ways&mdash;Nash clustering and counting the number of rock&ndash;paper&ndash;scissor cycles&mdash;on over one billion matches from the Lichess and FICS databases. Our findings indicate that the strategy space of real-world chess strategies has a spinning top geometry and that there exists a strong connection between the degree of non-transitivity and the progression of a chess player&rsquo;s rating. Particularly, high degrees of non-transitivity tend to prevent human players from making progress in their Elo ratings. We also investigate the implications of non-transitivity for population-based training methods. By considering fixed-memory fictitious play as a proxy, we conclude that maintaining large and diverse populations of strategies is imperative to training effective AI agents for solving chess.},
